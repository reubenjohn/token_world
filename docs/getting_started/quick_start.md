# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through running your first simulation in **Token World**. Follow these steps to set up a basic environment, initialize agents, and observe interactions.

> **WARNING: The below steps are for illustrative purposes only and not meant to serve as actual instructions**

## Step 1: Prepare the Environment

Ensure that Token World is properly installed on your system. If you haven’t set it up yet, refer to the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

---

## Step 2: Launch the Simulation

Run the following command to start a pre-configured simulation:
```bash
<Missing documentation>
```
This will initialize a small-town scenario with a few agents and entities interacting in a dynamic environment.

---

## Step 3: Observe the Output

As the simulation runs, you’ll see logs showing:
- **Agent Actions**: What actions each agent is performing.
- **State Changes**: Updates to entities based on agent interactions.
- **New Mechanics**: Dynamically generated mechanics triggered by agent behaviors.

Example:
```text
<Missing documentation>
[Agent: Alice] Action: "Eat apple."
[Environment] Preconditions met. Action executed.
[Entity: Apple] Removed from environment.
[Agent: Alice] Hunger reduced by 20 points.
```

## Step 4: Customize Your Simulation

Interact with the master environment agent to customize your simulation. For example:
- Add new agents with unique personality prompts.
- Define new entities with specific properties.
- Set global simulation parameters like time steps or logging verbosity. (Not implemented yet)

## Step 5: Visualize Interactions

Start the web-based debugging tool to observe agent interactions in real time:
```bash
<Missing documentation>
```
Access the tool in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## Step 6: Experiment and Iterate

Token World is designed for exploration. Experiment with:
- Adding complex scenarios.
- Creating new mechanics.
- Tuning agent behaviors.
