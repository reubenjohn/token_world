# Agent Evolution

Token World supports dynamic agent evolution, allowing agents to adapt, learn, and develop new goals and behaviors over time. This feature enhances the realism and depth of simulations, enabling the study of emergent behaviors and long-term interactions.

> Notes: Update the below documentation to focus on just goals and agent memory where other mechanics (relationship development, behavioral adaptation, etc) emerge from these two fundamental mechanics.

## Key Mechanisms of Agent Evolution

1. **Dynamic Goal Adjustment**  
   - Agents can modify their goals based on their interactions and environment changes.  
   - Example:
     - Initial Goal: *"Harvest apples."*
     - New Goal (post-interaction): *"Trade apples for coins."*

2. **Relationship Development**  
   - Agents track relationships with other agents, which influence future interactions.  
   - Example:
     - Positive Interaction: Builds trust for collaboration.
     - Negative Interaction: Leads to competition or conflict.

3. **Trait and Ability Growth**  
   - Agents can improve their traits or gain new abilities over time.  
   - Example:
     - A farmer agent gains the "plowing" ability after using a plow multiple times.

4. **Behavioral Adaptation**  
   - Agents adapt their strategies based on the success or failure of past actions.  
   - Example:
     - An explorer avoids dangerous areas after a failed exploration attempt.

## How It Works

### 1. Experience Tracking
- Agents maintain an internal record of:
  - Completed actions.
  - Interaction outcomes.
  - Changes in the environment.

### 2. Learning Mechanisms
- ~~**Reinforcement Learning**: Agents prioritize actions that yield positive results.~~
- **Feedback Integration**: Feedback from failed actions helps refine future decisions.

### 3. Personality Evolution
- Agentsâ€™ personalities evolve through repeated interactions.
- Example:
  - A "curious" agent becomes "cautious" after encountering multiple dangers.

## Example: Evolution in Action

### Initial State
- **Agent**: Alice, a farmer with basic farming skills.
- **Goal**: Harvest apples.

### Interaction
1. Alice completes multiple harvesting actions, gaining experience.
2. The environment introduces a new mechanic: trading resources.
3. Alice adjusts her goal to trade apples for tools.

### Outcome
- **New Trait**: Alice gains a "trading" ability.
- **Behavior Change**: Alice prioritizes trade over farming when tools are low.

## Experimentation Ideas

1. **Long-Term Scenarios**: Observe how agents evolve over hundreds of time steps.
2. **Competitive Dynamics**: Study evolution in competitive environments with scarce resources.
3. **Collaborative Growth**: Explore how relationships impact group evolution.
