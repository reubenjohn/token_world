## Core Features

1. **Dynamic Mechanics Generation**  
   - The mechanics of the simulation evolve on demand, based on the actions performed by agents.  
   - This ensures that simulations are not only adaptive but also reflective of the agents’ behaviors.

2. **Entity-Based Environment**  
   - Every element in the simulation is modeled as an entity with unique properties, stored in an SQLite database.  
   - Entities interact through precondition and effect-based actions, ensuring logical consistency.

3. **Agentic Interactions**  
   - Agents generate natural language actions, which are validated and executed using grounding mechanisms.  
   - This allows for realistic and meaningful behaviors in the simulation.

4. **Partial Observability Framework**  
   - Agents operate with limited knowledge of their environment.  
   - Exploration and interaction are required to uncover properties and expand their understanding.

5. **Web-Based Debugging Tool**  
   - Visualize interactions, inspect entity states, and debug simulations in real time.  
   - Provides an accessible interface for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Advanced Features

6. **Delegated Action Handling**  
   - Specialized sub-agents manage specific types of actions (e.g., navigation, item manipulation).  
   - Fallback mechanisms ensure robustness when actions cannot be executed.

7. **Customizability**  
   - Easily modify agents, entities, and scenarios to tailor simulations to your needs.  
   - Supports integration with various large language models, including lightweight local models.

8. **Scalability**  
   - Optimized for small to medium-scale simulations on personal laptops.  
   - Designed to support larger setups for advanced research or commercial applications.

9. **Interpretable Logging**  
   - Logs every interaction and state change, allowing users to analyze agent behaviors and simulation dynamics.  
   - Provides valuable insights for debugging and iterative development.
