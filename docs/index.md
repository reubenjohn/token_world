# Token World

**Token World** is a dynamic, multi-agent simulation framework leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) to create open-ended, evolving environments. Designed for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts, Token World enables the exploration of emergent behaviors, agentic workflows, and complex interactions in various scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Mechanics Generation**: The simulation evolves as agents interact, creating new mechanics on demand based on actions performed.
- **Entity-Based Design**: Each element in the environment is represented as an entity with unique properties and interactions.
- **Grounded Interactions**: Actions are validated with logical preconditions and effects to ensure consistency and realism.
- **Partial Observability**: Agents explore and uncover properties of their environment through interactions.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily customize agents, entities, and scenarios to suit your needs.
