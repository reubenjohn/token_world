## Inspiration

Very loosely inspired by:

Park, J. S., O'Brien, J. C., Cai, C. J., Morris, M. R., Liang, P., & Bernstein, M. S. (2023). Generative agents: Interactive simulacra of human behavior. Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, 2:1â€“2:22. https://doi.org/10.1145/3586183.3606763

Also inspired by advancements in:
- **Agentic Workflows**: The integration of multi-agent systems with large language models.
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Studies in artificial intelligence that focus on unplanned yet meaningful system outcomes.
- **Simulation Frameworks**: Tools like Unity and OpenAI Gym that provide rich environments for experimentation.

## Tools and Libraries

This project relies on the following tools and libraries:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language for the core implementation.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) - Lightweight database for entity management.
- Streamlit - Framework for the web-based debugging tool.
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) - Testing framework for reliable code validation.
